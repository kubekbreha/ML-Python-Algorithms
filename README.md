# ML-Python-Algorithms

This project document my machine learning learning process (hmm. that sounds kind of cool). I will upload here different algorithms and all sort of small projects which is using any form of machine learning.

## Implemented  algorithms

* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/kubekbreha/ML-Python-Algorithms/tree/master/naive_bayes)
* [SVM](https://github.com/kubekbreha/ML-Python-Algorithms/tree/master/svm)

## Using

* [SKLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - ML library for Python
